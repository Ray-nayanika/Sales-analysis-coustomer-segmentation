Mapped Sales Distribution: Designed a fill map to represent sales by location, using color intensity to indicate sales volume, thereby identifying high-performing regions.

Analyzed Purchases by Location: Developed a horizontal bar chart to display total purchases by location, segmented by category, to provide a detailed view of geographic and category-wise sales distribution.

Enhanced User Experience: Utilized advanced DAX functions and data modeling techniques to improve data interaction and reporting, facilitating better decision-making.
